The meeting, held on February 13, 2025, was initiated by André Neiva, who began by discussing the format and objectives of the session with his colleagues, Rita Joana and Daniel Furtado. They were reviewing a report from a previous meeting held two days prior, focusing on the effectiveness of their training models and future developments. André outlined that their goal was to automate the reporting process following training sessions, enabling participants to receive tailored feedback based on their engagement levels and performance during the training.

The discussion shifted to the importance of capturing engagement metrics, where they could analyze data on participant involvement, attention spans, and areas needing improvement. For instance, if a particular slide or topic led to a drop in engagement, trainers could adjust their approach in future sessions. They emphasized the need for reports to be structured in a way that both trainers and participants could benefit, offering insights into individual and group performance.

Francisco Falcão joined the conversation, contributing insights about the potential applications of their technology in various training environments, including corporate and sports settings. He highlighted the need to track student engagement and the importance of capturing data in real-time, which could enhance the learning experience significantly.

As they continued discussing the report, the group acknowledged some manual processes still in place but expressed optimism about their plans to move towards a more automated system. They shared examples of how feedback could be personalized, allowing trainers to understand which students needed more support and what resources could be recommended to them.

Rita then shared her experiences with the IFMT, a training institution, detailing how stringent regulations impacted their operations. She explained how her organization was looking to enhance training delivery through effective data collection and analysis, ultimately aiming for better outcomes for the participants. The conversation then turned towards the challenges of ensuring that students remained engaged, especially in mandatory training sessions, and how their system could help in creating a more interactive and beneficial training environment.

The meeting also touched on the legal considerations surrounding data privacy and the importance of obtaining consent from participants prior to recording and analyzing their data. André and Francisco discussed possible solutions to ensure that the necessary permissions were acquired without causing discomfort to the participants.

As the meeting progressed, the team brainstormed ways to market their training solutions effectively. They recognized the importance of demonstrating the value of their reporting tools to potential clients, emphasizing how these tools could aid in measuring training effectiveness and enhancing the learning experience.

Towards the end of the meeting, there was a shift in focus to the practicalities of implementing their training models and how to navigate potential hurdles with clients. Rita expressed her commitment to securing a training opportunity with a company and ensuring that all logistical and regulatory requirements were met. The meeting concluded with an agreement to follow up on several action items, including sending out reports and further discussions with potential clients.

Overall, the meeting was a collaborative effort to refine their training and reporting systems, ensuring they could deliver effective and engaging learning experiences while navigating the complexities of data management and client relationships.
