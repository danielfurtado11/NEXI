On February 13, 2025, a meeting was held to discuss the implementation of a new platform for training and reporting within the context of educational courses. André Neiva initiated the meeting and introduced the participants, mentioning Daniel Furtado, an engineer and web student, and Rita Joana, also a web student. They discussed the objectives of the meeting, which included reviewing models and future developments, sharing a report from a previous meeting, and outlining next steps.

André explained that the platform they are developing aims to automate the process of capturing engagement and participation during training sessions. He emphasized the importance of having a structured report following each session, which would include insights on what was discussed and the effectiveness of the training. The reports are tailored to each participant, revealing their individual engagement levels and providing feedback on areas that need improvement. This feature aims to enhance the training experience by allowing instructors to adjust their teaching methods based on real-time data about student engagement.

During the meeting, they discussed a report from a meeting held two days prior, detailing the objectives set and whether they were achieved. André highlighted that the platform can differentiate reports for different roles, such as trainers and students, ensuring that everyone receives relevant information. For example, if a slide caused disengagement, the trainer would be informed of this in the report, allowing them to modify their approach in future sessions.

Rita contributed by discussing her experiences with a training organization (Ifmt) that provides online courses for drivers, emphasizing the strict regulations they must follow. She mentioned the difficulty in ensuring the quality of feedback and the challenges faced when dealing with participant evaluations, which can sometimes be misleading. This led to a broader discussion on the importance of having accurate data to assess the effectiveness of training and to meet the expectations of both trainers and participants.

Francisco Falcão joined the meeting and engaged in the conversation, sharing insights about how the platform can be beneficial for trainers by helping them identify which teaching methods resonate with students and which do not. The discussion turned to the potential for the platform to be used in various educational settings, including universities, and how it might help track student progress over time.

As the meeting progressed, they explored the idea of providing students with access to their training history, allowing them to retrieve valuable information about past sessions, which could assist them in future job applications or interviews. Francisco emphasized the dual function of the platform: it serves as a knowledge repository for students and a feedback tool for trainers.

Rita expressed her enthusiasm for the platform and its potential to transform training experiences. They discussed the importance of getting buy-in from trainers and institutions, ensuring they understand the benefits of using the platform effectively. The conversation included strategies for communicating these advantages clearly to stakeholders.

Towards the conclusion of the meeting, André mentioned the next steps, which included sending an email to the University of Minho to propose collaboration and discuss legal aspects regarding data usage and participant consent. They recognized the need to establish clear communication with participants about the recordings and data collection processes, ensuring transparency and compliance with data protection regulations.

The meeting wrapped up with everyone agreeing that the discussion was productive and that they would follow up on their respective tasks. Rita committed to reaching out to her contacts to gather more feedback and updates on the training organization she represents. The meeting ended with a friendly exchange among the participants, reflecting a positive team dynamic and a shared commitment to improving the training process through the innovative platform they are developing.
