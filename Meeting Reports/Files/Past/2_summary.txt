The meeting, initiated by André Neiva, focused on discussing a report from a recent meeting, outlining the tools and methodologies they are developing for educational purposes. André introduced Daniel Furtado, an engineer from NEX, and emphasized the collaborative nature of their team, which includes knowledgeable members from various educational backgrounds. The primary aim was to enhance the effectiveness of training sessions and ensure that feedback is collected in a meaningful way. They discussed the importance of capturing engagement metrics during training sessions to analyze how well participants are absorbing the material.

André explained that the team has been working on automating the process of generating reports after meetings, allowing participants to receive personalized feedback and suggestions based on their involvement. This includes tracking participation levels and identifying specific moments in the training where engagement dipped. The report would provide insights into which parts of the training were effective and which were not, allowing trainers to adjust their methods accordingly in future sessions.

Rita Joana contributed by emphasizing the importance of detailed feedback from training sessions, sharing her experiences with an institution that mandates rigorous documentation and evaluation of its training processes. She highlighted the challenges of managing expectations from various stakeholders, expressing a desire for a more transparent and effective way to assess training outcomes. The conversation turned to the legal aspects of recording training sessions, with discussions on how to obtain permissions from participants and the implications of data protection laws.

Daniel and Francisco Falcão discussed the technical aspects of their platform, which aims to record sessions, analyze engagement through facial recognition, and provide detailed reports to both trainers and participants. They noted that while they have successfully implemented these tools in online training, they are still exploring how to effectively apply them in face-to-face settings. The importance of understanding participant engagement visually and through direct feedback was stressed, along with the need for enhancing the user interface of their reporting system.

Rita also shared insights on how her recent experiences with other organizations could provide valuable lessons for their platform, particularly concerning the need for adaptability in training formats. The meeting concluded with plans for follow-up actions, including sending reports from the session, reaching out to potential trainers, and refining their platform based on the feedback received. The group acknowledged the importance of continuous improvement and the role of technology in enhancing training efficacy, emphasizing the need for data-driven decisions in educational settings. Overall, the discussion was productive, aiming to create a more engaging and effective training experience for all participants involved.
