In a meeting held on February 13, 2025, André Neiva initiated the session, discussing various aspects of their educational platform and its functionalities. The meeting involved participants including Rita Joana, Daniel Furtado, and Francisco Falcão. Initially, André introduced Daniel, emphasizing his background in engineering and web development, and noted the group’s shared origin from Barcelos, fostering a familial atmosphere.

The discussion primarily revolved around the platform's capabilities in enhancing educational engagements. André explained their objective of automating the process of capturing meeting reports and feedback from training sessions, which would be sent out shortly after the conclusion of the meetings. This automation aims to streamline the reporting process, providing tailored insights to different stakeholders such as trainers and participants. For instance, the platform allows for individual reports for each participant, highlighting their engagement levels, moments when attention waned, and suggestions for improvement, thus fostering a more effective learning environment.

Rita and André elaborated on the significance of these reports in evaluating the effectiveness of training sessions. They discussed how the platform tracks engagement metrics, such as attention spans and participation rates, and how trainers could use this data to adapt their teaching methods. The conversation transitioned to a specific example where the team analyzed a recent meeting report, noting that certain topics led to a drop in engagement, prompting discussion on how to adjust future presentations accordingly.

As the meeting progressed, Francisco joined the conversation, sharing insights on the potential applications of their platform in various settings beyond traditional education, including corporate training and sports coaching. The group acknowledged the need for clarity in how the platform operates and the importance of obtaining participant consent for recording sessions, emphasizing transparency in data handling.

Rita shared her experiences with a federal training institution and the rigorous standards they impose, noting the challenges in obtaining accurate feedback from participants who may not be engaged. The discussion highlighted the differences between mandatory and voluntary training, with Rita asserting that voluntary training often yields better engagement and outcomes.

The meeting also touched on the platform's long-term vision, including the development of a comprehensive repository where participants could access their training history and resources, enhancing their lifelong learning journey. They envisioned a system where learners could revisit materials from past courses and leverage insights from their training experiences.

Towards the end of the meeting, the group discussed next steps, including reaching out to the University of Minho for potential collaboration and clarifying legal considerations regarding participant data. The conversation concluded with a sense of optimism about the platform's future and its potential to revolutionize the training landscape.

Overall, the meeting was a collaborative effort to refine the educational platform's offerings, enhance participant engagement, and establish a framework for effective training evaluation, grounded in data-driven insights. The participants expressed enthusiasm for the developments ahead and the impact they could have on educational methodologies.
